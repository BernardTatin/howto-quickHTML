            <h2>IMPORTANT</h2>
            <p>This is a work in progress, come back later to get a real stable release.</p>
            <p>I'm french, so you can find my bad English is really bad. Tell me, I will correct. </p>
            <h2>some words</h2>

            <p>I often write a few HTML pages for documentation, stats presentation, ... and each time I need to search the preceding one to paste and copy CSS, Javascript and HTML in the new one. <em>GitHub</em> is a nice place to put definitive version of all these lines of CSS, Javascript and HTML.</p>
            <p>This work results in a small HTML site showing in a few steps what I have done in that code. Writing these lines of text and code, I extends my first aim and I will show some CSS frameworks and use <em>Ajax requests</em> to obtain a real little <em>CMS</em>.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that this work is not targetting big web sites, only a few pages of text or some daily logs produced externally (there will be an exemple somewhere).</p>

            <h2>installation</h2>
            <p>Just put the content of the <a href="https://github.com/BernardTatin/howto-quickHTML/archive/master.zip">archive</a> in aplace where your Web Server can  access it.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> because I use some <em>Ajax</em> requests, it is easier to use a Web server as Apache, Nginx, Lighttpd.... Some browsers, as <em>Google Chrome</em> can handle these request without it but you had to configure it in a debug mode.</p>

            <h2>usage</h2>
            <p>follow the steps you will find in the left column, look at the code, modify it, play with it and have fun!</p>
