## IMPORTANT

This is a work in progress, come back later to get a real stable release.

I'm french, so you can find my bad English is really bad. Tell me, I will correct.
##some words


I often write a few HTML pages for documentation, stats presentation, ... and each time I need to search the preceding one to paste and copy CSS, Javascript and HTML in the new one. _GitHub_ is a nice place to put definitive version of all these lines of CSS, Javascript and HTML.

This work results in a small HTML site showing in a few steps what I have done in that code. Writing these lines of text and code, I extends my first aim and I will show some CSS frameworks and use _Ajax requests_ to obtain a real little _CMS_.

Keep in mind that this work is not targetting big web sites, only a few pages of text or some daily logs produced externally (there will be an exemple somewhere).

## installation

Just put the content of the <a href="https://github.com/BernardTatin/howto-quickHTML/archive/master.zip">archive</a> in aplace where your Web Server can  access it.

__Note:__ because I use some _Ajax_ requests, it is easier to use a Web server as Apache, Nginx, Lighttpd.... Some browsers, as _Google Chrome_ can handle these request without it but you had to configure it in a debug mode.

## usage

follow the steps you will find in the left column, look at the code, modify it, play with it and have fun!
