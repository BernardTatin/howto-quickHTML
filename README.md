# howto-quickHTML
How to make a quick and nice HTML/CSS page? It's not so hard. I've done all this on Linux but it can be easily done on Windows.

First, I use [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), the best editor for the Web which works everywhere, and [Less](http://lesscss.org/), a CSS preprocessor who can produce CSS directly from [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).

## note
I'm french and I'm not sure my english is good, sorry for that :)
