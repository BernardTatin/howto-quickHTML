This is a work in progress. The _master_ branch is the stable one. The _dev_ branch, as you can guess, is the development branch.

# how to quick HTML
How to make a quick and nice HTML/CSS page? It's not so hard. I've done all this on Linux but it can be easily done on Windows.

First, I use [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), the best editor for the Web which works everywhere, and [Less](http://lesscss.org/), a CSS preprocessor who can produce CSS directly from [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).

When _Brackets_ works, be sure you have two extensions for lesss :
 - _LESS AutoCompile_, to compile _Less_ files on saving,
 - _LessHints_, which helps you to complete names.

I'm french and I'm not sure my english is good, sorry for that :)
